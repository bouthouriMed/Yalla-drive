# Yalla-drive

Yalla Drive a platform for carpooling, my final project for my 4 months fullstack Javascript developer program at GoMyCode.

It a platform that after signing up using JWT authentification, gives you the ability to create a profile then searching for rides offered by other users and connect with each other with features like sendong and recieving, accepting,declining or deleting requests, liking, posting, deleting rides, recieving notifications and editing profile.

It also has an admin interface which gives you the ability the delete users with their profiles and rides along with all their entire interactions with other users in the application, or deleting only the rides.

This application was created with React and Redux using a UI template with Tailwind css which is provided in the re√¥sitry under the name of "Uplabs-template" along with some Material UI components, NodeJs with Express and MongoDB.

It's only 2 weeks project, so it has important limitations, like the narrow selected inputs for the source and destination of the ride which were intended for the expected filter search feature that i wasn't able to add due to my other engagments.
It also uses Gravatar for user's pictures, so if the user is registered with an email that doesn't use Gravatar, the user's avatar will be empty.
